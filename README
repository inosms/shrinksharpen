this is a simple algorithm that sharpens images by shrinking transitions.

Until now it is just a very early version and it only works on certain images such as ones with large same colored areas. Also the image must not be _too_ blurred. This is no magical algorithm...

example images:

<img src="example.png">

<img src="example2.png">
